\section{Aerodynamic Elements}
\label{sec:EL:AERO}


\subsection{Aerodynamic Body/Aerodynamic Beam2/3}
\label{sec:EL:AERO:BODY-BEAM23}
These elements share the description of the aerodynamics.
The former assumes the aerodynamic surface to be rigid,
and takes its configuration from a single node, while the latter
respectively relies on a two or three-node beam
and use the same interpolation functions of the beam to compute
the configuration at an arbitrary point.

The input format is:

    \bnt{custom_output} ::= \kw{custom output} , 
        \bnt{custom_output_flag} [ , ... ]
\end{Verbatim}
%\end{verbatim}
The values of \nt{custom\_output\_flag}
are defined in Section~\ref{sec:CONTROLDATA:DEFAULTAERODYNAMICOUTPUT}.

Flags add up to form the custom output request.
Flags may not be repeated.
By default, only forces are output.
The custom output is only available in NetCDF format;
see Section~\ref{sec:NetCDF:Elem:Aerodynamic}.

The field \nt{induced\_velocity} indicates the label
of the \kw{induced velocity} element that this element is linked to.
This means that the element can get information about the
induced velocity and should supply information about the forces it generates.
If the keyword \kw{user defined induced velocity} is used,
then \nt{induced\_velocity} refers to a \kw{user defined} element.
Note: if the keyword \kw{induced velocity} is used
and no induced velocity element is found with the label \nt{induced velocity}
a \kw{user defined} element with that label is looked up.
% If the optional (MISSING TEXT)

An arbitrary relative orientation and offset is allowed for all elements with
respect to the nodes they are linked to. 
This means that the aerodynamic beam offsets refer to the position
of the beam's nodes, and have nothing to do with offsets related
to the structural beam element.

The \htybkw{Shape}{1D} entities are used to compute the physical chord,
aerodynamic center, velocity measurement point (the point where the
kinematic boundary conditions are evaluated) and twist, in radians, as functions 
of the dimensionless abscissa along the span.

The optional \kw{tip loss} keyword allows to define an additional shape,
\nt{tip\_loss},
whose value is used to scale the value of the normal aerodynamic force.
By default, the scale factor is 1.
The \nt{tip\_loss} shape should have a value comprised between 0 and 1.

In any case, the user must be aware of the fact that Gauss integration
will be used over the span of the element.
This consists in evaluating forces at specific spanwise stations.
This assumes that the function to be integrated over the spanwise domain
is regular.
Sharp variations, like tip loss concentrated in the outermost 2\%
of a rotor blade span, might be entirely missed when using too little
spanwise elements with too little integration points.

The span of the \kw{aerodynamic body} element is set by the user;
the offset vector points to the center-span of the element.
The span of the \kw{aerodynamic beam2} and \kw{aerodynamic beam3} elements
is computed based on the metric of the beam, from the first to the last node.

The aerodynamic center and the velocity measurement points are measured
relative to the centerline of the elements, that is the line in direction 3
of the local frame from the end of the offset vector.
This line is assumed to be at the 25\% of the airfoil chord when steady
aerodynamic coefficients are used (\nt{unsteady\_flag} = 0).
The direction 1 is assumed to be the ``reference'' line of the airfoil, 
from the trailing edge to the leading edge (points ``forward''),
while direction 2 is normal to the other two and goes from the lower 
to the upper side of the airfoil (points ``up''). 
Figure~\ref{fig:AIRFOIL} shows the arrangement of the airfoil geometry 
and properties.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=80mm]{airfoil}
  \caption{Airfoil geometry}\label{fig:AIRFOIL}
\end{figure}

The \nt{airfoil\_data} defaults to a built-in NACA 0012 semi-analytical
model (FIXME: the unsteady correction is buggy; use the \kw{c81} 
mode instead).

The \kw{multiple} mode of the c81 data allows to specify
more than one airfoil for an aerodynamic element; the transition
between airfoils is sharp.
The integer \nt{airfoil\_number} indicates how many airfoils are expected;
the real \nt{end\_point} indicates where the influence zone for that
airfoil ends, expressed in terms of a non-dimensional abscissa spanning 
$\plbr{-1,1}$ along the reference line, roughly along axis 3 
of the aerodynamic reference frame; \nt{end\_point} must not lie outside
the element.
So, for example, if airfoil NACA 0015 is used in the leftmost part
of an element up to 1/4 span, NACA 0012 is used from 1/4 to 3/4 span,
and NACA 0009 is used in the remaining rightmost 1/4, the syntax is:
\begin{verbatim}
    set: integer naca0015 = 15;
    set: integer naca0012 = 12;
    set: integer naca0009 = 9;
    c81 data: naca0015, "naca0015.c81";
    c81 data: naca0012, "naca0012.c81";
    c81 data: naca0009, "naca0009.c81";
    # beginning of aerodynamic element definition...
        multiple, 3,
            naca0015, -0.5,    # from -1.0 to -0.5
            naca0012,  0.5,    # from -0.5 to  0.5
            naca0009,  1.0,    # from  0.5 to  1.0
    # ...rest of aerodynamic element definition
\end{verbatim}

The \kw{interpolated} mode of the \kw{c81} data allows to specify 
a smooth transition between different airfoils inside an element.
The interpolation occurs at the integration points where the
aerodynamic data are required, and it is performed once for all
at the beginning of the analysis.
Since this operation is time consuming, and essentially unnecessary,
the interpolated data can be generated once for all with the utility
\texttt{util/c81merge} once the position of the integration point is known,
and the \kw{multiple} mode can be used to directly provide
the interpolated data to the aerodynamic element.

The \kw{theodorsen} aerodynamic data uses C81 data,
and superimposes Wagner's approximation of the Theodorsen incompressible
unsteady correction of 2D lift and moment coefficients.
It is experimental.

The \nt{extra\_arglist} allows to define the style of the output.
The \kw{std} style (the default), the \kw{gauss} and the \kw{node}
styles are illustrated in the output section.


\subsubsection{Output}
Aerodynamic elements, both bodies and beams, write their output with file
extension \texttt{.aer}; for each time step the required elements are output.
In any case the label of the element is output first.
Three different formats are available: \kw{std} (the default),
\kw{gauss} and \kw{node}.

\begin{itemize}
\item[\kw{std}] (or Coefficients at Gauss points):
the output consists in a set of 8 numbers
for each block, that describe data at each Gauss integration point;
multiple blocks for a single element are written on the same line.
The format is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the angle of attack at that station, in degrees 
	(namely, the angle between the component of the airfoil velocity,
	evaluated at the velocity measurement point, that in the airfoil
	plane and a reference line on the airfoil)
    \item the local yaw angle, in degrees
	(namely, the angle whose tangent is the ratio
	between the axial and the inplane components of the airfoil
	velocity)
    \item the local Mach number
    \item the local lift coefficient
    \item the local drag coefficient
    \item the local aerodynamic moment coefficient
    \item a private number
    \item another private number
\end{itemize}
When \kw{aerodynamic beam2} and \kw{aerodynamic beam3} elements are considered,
the output is repeated for each portion of the beam; so, for example,
a two-node beam is split in two portions, so the output
contains $2\times \nt{integration\_points}$ data blocks,
while a three-node beam is split in three portions,
so the output contains $3\times \nt{integration\_points}$ data blocks.

\item[\kw{node}:]
the format is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the label of the node
    \item the three components of the force applied to the node
    \item the three components of the couple applied to the node
\end{itemize}
When \kw{aerodynamic beam2} and \kw{aerodynamic beam3} elements are considered,
the output is repeated on the same line for each node
the element is connected to.

\item[\kw{gauss}] (or Forces at Gauss points):
the output consists in the forces and moments
per unit length at each Gauss integration point; the format is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the direction of the wind velocity relative to the element frame
    \item the lift,
    \item the drag,
    \item and the aerodynamic moment per unit length
\end{itemize}
When \kw{aerodynamic beam2} \and \kw{aerodynamic beam3} elements are considered,
the output is repeated on the same line for each portion of beam.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Aeromodal Element}
\emph{Note: implemented by Giuseppe Quaranta; documented by Alessandro Scotti.}

\noindent
This element is used to model an aerodynamic modal element,
i.e.\ an unsteady aerodynamic model that inherits the structural 
motion from a \htmlref{\kw{modal joint}}{sec:EL:STRUCT:JOINT:MODAL} element.
Its definition is very similar to that of the modal element, 
but it also includes some data representing unsteady aerodynamics 
in the time domain trough the residualization matrices.
This element is defined as follows:
%\begin{verbatim}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    \bnt{elem_type} ::= \kw{aeromodal}

    \bnt{normal_arglist} ::= 
        \bnt{reference_modal_joint} ,
        (\hty{OrientationMatrix}) \bnt{orientation} ,
        \bnt{reference_chord} ,
        \bnt{number_of_aerodynamic_states} ,
        [ \kw{rigid} , ]
        [ \kw{gust} , \bnt{Vff} , ]
        " \bnt{modal_matrices_file} "
\end{Verbatim}
%\end{verbatim}
With this formulation, anytime an \kw{aeromodal} element is defined, 
the user needs to declare the number of modal aerodynamic elements 
in use in the \kw{control data} section.
An \htmlref{\kw{air properties}}{sec:EL:AERO:AIRPROPERTIES}
card definition is also required.

The label \nt{reference\_modal\_joint} indicates
the \htmlref{\kw{modal joint}}{sec:EL:STRUCT:JOINT:MODAL}
associated to the \kw{aeromodal} element.
The modal joint must be connected to a \kw{modal} node;
clamped modal joints are not supported.

The keyword \kw{rigid} indicates that the generalized aerodynamic forces
provided by the model include global forces and moments associated 
to the rigid body motion of the underlying modal element (FIXME: untested).

The keyword \kw{gust} activates an optional gust model,
which is totally undocumented;
for further information, please contact the Author(s).

The \nt{modal\_matrices\_file} file is an ASCII file that contains
the matrices $\T{A}$, $\T{B}$, $\T{C}$, $\T{D}_0$, $\T{D}_1$ and $\T{D}_2$,
of a state space model according to the representation
\begin{align*}
	\dot{\T{x}}
	&=
	\T{A}\T{x} + \T{B}\T{q}
	\\
	\T{f}
	&=
	q\plbr{\T{C}\T{x} + \T{D}_0 \T{q} + \frac{c}{2V_{\infty}} \T{D}_1 \dot{\T{q}} + \plbr{\frac{c}{2V_{\infty}}}^2 \T{D}_2 \ddot{\T{q}}}
\end{align*}
where $\T{x}$ are the \nt{number\_of\_aerodynamic\_states} (\nt{na})
aerodynamic state variables,
$\T{q}$ are the \nt{ns} modal variables that describe the structural motion
as defined in the related \htmlref{\kw{modal joint}}{sec:EL:STRUCT:JOINT:MODAL},
$c$ is the reference length, $V_\infty$ is the free airstream velocity,
$q = \rho V_{\infty}^2/2$ is the dynamic pressure,
and $\T{f}$ are the unsteady aerodynamic forces applied to the structural
dynamics equations.

When the keyword \kw{rigid} is present, the number of modal variables \nt{ns}
includes the modes provided
by the \htmlref{\kw{modal joint}}{sec:EL:STRUCT:JOINT:MODAL}
plus 6 rigid-body modes corresponding to rigid-body displacement
and rotation of the \kw{modal node}.

The file is formatted as follows:
%\begin{verbatim}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    *** MATRIX A
    (\bnt{na} x \bnt{na} coefficients)
    *** MATRIX B
    (\bnt{na} x \bnt{ns} coefficients)
    *** MATRIX C
    (\bnt{ns} x \bnt{na} coefficients)
    *** MATRIX D0
    (\bnt{ns} x \bnt{ns} coefficients)
    *** MATRIX D1
    (\bnt{ns} x \bnt{ns} coefficients)
    *** MATRIX D2
    (\bnt{ns} x \bnt{ns} coefficients)
\end{Verbatim}
%\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Example.} \
\begin{verbatim}
    aeromodal: WING, WING_JOINT,
        eye,
        131.25, 10, "ha145b.fea";
\end{verbatim}
The \kw{aeromodal} element is declared with the label \texttt{WING}.
This element is attached to a \kw{modal} joint 
named \texttt{WING\_JOINT}.
The orientation of the aerodynamic reference with respect 
to the nodal reference is here expressed by the identity matrix (\kw{eye}).
The aerodynamic element chord is 131.25 inches.
This quantity must be consistent with the system chosen to define 
the whole model (SI, for example; in this case, British Units).
The next field, 10, indicates the number of states needed to use 
the aerodynamic model.
\texttt{ha145b.fea} is the name of the file that contains
the state space model matrices, obtained with an approximation 
chosen by the user.
In this particular case, a 10 states Pad\'e approximation 
has been chosen.
This example is taken from the Bisplinghoff Ashley Halfman
(BAH) Jet Transport Wing cantilevered wing with modal aerodynamic 
frequency response, computed by a double-lattice method at Mach 0.0.
Data were extracted from the MSC-NASTRAN aeroelastic example file, 
named \texttt{ha145b}, while the aerodynamic state-space fitting 
has been computed using a Pad\'e polynomial approximation
(by Pasinetti \& Mantegazza, \cite{PASINETTI-MANTEGAZZA-1999}).
All quantities are expressed in inches and pounds.



\subsection{Aircraft Instruments}
%\begin{verbatim}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    \bnt{elem_type} ::= \kw{aircraft instruments}

    \bnt{normal_arglist} ::= \bnt{aircraft_node}
        [ , \kw{orientation} , \{ \kw{flight mechanics} | \kw{aeroelasticity}
            | (\hty{OrientationMatrix}) \bnt{relative_orientation} \} ]
\end{Verbatim}
%\end{verbatim}
The \nt{aircraft\_node} represents the aircraft; it is assumed
that the positive $x$ direction of the node is tail to nose of the aircraft,
the positive $z$ direction of the node is top to bottom of the aircraft,
and the positive $y$ direction of the node is to the right of the pilot.
The node representing the aircraft is intended in a ``world''
reference frame whose positive $z$ direction points upward
and whose positive $x$ direction points north
(note that currently the world is flat).

An optional orientation can be added to change the orientation 
of the aircraft with respect to the node.
This is useful, for example, with aeroelasticity, in which conventionally
the positive direction of the $x$ axis is nose to tail,
and the positive direction of the $z$ axis is bottom to top.
The keyword \kw{flight mechanics} indicates that the node representing
the aircraft is oriented according to the default orientation
of the element, whereas the keyword \kw{aeroelasticity}
indicates that the node representing the aircraft is oriented accordingly.
Arbitrary orientations can be dealt with by providing an appropriate
\nt{relative\_orientation} matrix.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{elicottero}
\end{center}

The available measures are accessed during the simulation 
by defining appropriate \kw{parameter} nodes, and by binding
the \kw{aircraft instruments} element private data to the nodes 
by means of the \kw{bind} mechanism, or directly by means
of the 
\hyperref{\kw{element} drive}{\kw{element} drive (see Section~}{)}{sec:DriveCaller:ELEMENT}.

\paragraph{Private Data}
The following data are available:
\begin{itemize}
\item \kw{"airspeed"}: the airspeed as seen by the reference 
	point on the aircraft, i.e.\ the absolute value
	of the combination of the airstream speed and of the node speed
\item \kw{"groundspeed"}: the absolute value of the projection
	of the node speed in the $xy$ plane of the ``world''
\item \kw{"altitude"}: the $z$ component of the node position
	with respect to the ``world''
\item \kw{"attitude"}: $\tan^{-1}\plbr{r_{31}, r_{11}}$
	% (FIXME: better $\arcsin\plbr{r_{31}}$?)

	% (FIXME: better $\arcsin\plbr{r_{32}}$?)
\item \kw{"turn"}: \emph{(FIXME: not implemented yet)}
\item \kw{"slip"}: \emph{(FIXME: not implemented yet)}
\item \kw{"verticalspeed"}: the $z$ component of the node velocity
	in the ``world'' reference system
\item \kw{"angleofattack"}: the angle between the local $z$ and $x$ components
	of the velocity (airstream plus node),
	expressed in the reference frame of the aircraft
\item \kw{"heading"}: the angle between the $x$ axis of the aircraft 
	and the ``north'' (the global $x$ axis) about the global $z$ axis;
	note: heading wraps about South
	(+180 deg from East, -180 deg from West).
\item \kw{"longitude"}: \emph{(FIXME: not implemented yet)}
\item \kw{"latitude"}: \emph{(FIXME: not implemented yet)}
\item \kw{"rollrate"}: the component of the angular velocity
	of the node representing the aircraft along the $x$ axis
	of the node itself (positive when the right wing moves downward)
\item \kw{"pitchrate"}: the component of the angular velocity
	of the node representing the aircraft along the $y$ axis
	of the node itself (positive when the nose pitches upward)
\item \kw{"yawrate"}: the component of the angular velocity
	of the node representing the aircraft along the $z$ axis
	of the node itself (positive when the right wing moves backward)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Air Properties}\label{sec:EL:AERO:AIRPROPERTIES}
The properties of the airstream are made of the physical properties
of the air plus the description of the airstream velocity direction
and amplitude.
The former can be expressed in different forms, while the latter
are based on three-dimensional drive callers, \htybty{TplDriveCaller}{Vec3}.

                [ , \kw{temperature deviation} , \bnt{delta_T} ]

\end{Verbatim}
%\end{verbatim}
The first form consists in the bare input of the air density,
in form of a drive caller, and of the sound celerity, e.g.:
\begin{verbatim}
    air properties: 1.225, 340.,
        1.,0.,0., 150.;
\end{verbatim}
The second form uses standard air properties, both in the
international system (SI) or in British units.
A temperature deviation and an altitude offset can be defined, e.g.:
\begin{verbatim}
    air properties: std, SI, temperature deviation, -55,
        reference altitude, 1000.,
        1.,0.,0., 150.;
\end{verbatim}
where standard properties in SI are used, with a temperature
deviation of -55 K and a reference altitude of 1000 m.
The air properties are computed based on the $z$ position of the
point where the \kw{air properties} are requested (plus the optional
altitude offset).
The last possibility lets the user input all the parameters
required to compute the \kw{air properties} based on the $z$ position
of the point where they are requested, namely the reference
pressure \nt{p0}, the reference density \nt{rho0},
the reference temperature \nt{T0}, the initial temperature
gradient \nt{dT/dz}, the gas constant \nt{R}, the
initial gravity acceleration \nt{g0}, the bottom and top
altitudes of the null temperature gradient region \nt{z1} and
\nt{z2}; e.g., for SI units:
\begin{verbatim}
    air properties: std,
        101325.,       /* Pa, 1 bar */
        1.2250,        /* kg/m^3 */
        288.16,        /* K, ISA: 15 C */
        -6.5e-3,       /* K/m */
        287.,          /* J/kgK */
        9.81,          /* m/s^2 */
        11000.,        /* m */
        25000.,        /* m */
        temperature deviation, -55,
        reference altitude, 1000.,
        1.,0.,0., 150.;
\end{verbatim}
The air properties are defined according to the formulas
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	\rcubr{\lvvect{
		T = \nt{T0} + \nt{dT/dz} \cdot z
		\\
		p = \nt{p0} \plbr{\cfrac{T}{\nt{T0}}}^{-\frac{\nt{g0}}{\nt{dT/dz} \cdot \nt{R}}}
		\\
		\rho = \nt{rho0} \plbr{\cfrac{T}{\nt{T0}}}^{-\plbr{\frac{\nt{g0}}{\nt{dT/dz} \cdot \nt{R}} + 1}}
	}}
	&&& z < \nt{z1}
	\\
	\rcubr{\lvvect{
		T = \nt{T0} + \nt{dT/dz} \cdot \nt{z1}
		\\
		p = \plbr{\nt{p0}\plbr{\cfrac{T}{\nt{T0}}}^{-\frac{\nt{g0}}{\nt{dT/dz} \cdot \nt{R}}}}
			\mathrm{e}^{-\nt{g0} \frac{z - \nt{z1}}{\nt{dT/dz} \cdot \nt{R}}}
		\\
		\rho = \nt{rho0} \plbr{\cfrac{T}{\nt{T0}}}^{-\plbr{\frac{\nt{g0}}{\nt{dT/dz} \cdot \nt{R}} + 1}}
			\mathrm{e}^{-\nt{g0} \frac{z - \nt{z1}}{\nt{dT/dz} \cdot \nt{R}}}
	}}
	&&& \nt{z1} \le z < \nt{z2}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The case of $z > \nt{z2}$ is not currently handled;
the formulas for $z \ge \nt{z1}$ are actually used.
The value of $z$ is computed by adding the $z$ component
of the position where the air properties are computed
to the reference altitude \nt{z0}.

The asymptotic air properties are characterized by \nt{air\_speed},
the \htybty{TplDriveCaller}{Vec3} of the air speed,
expressed in the global reference frame.
The possibility to vary the density and the airspeed using a driver
has little physical meaning, especially the former;
is intended as a practical means to gradually introduce
the desired air properties, and the related airloads, in the analysis.

\subsubsection{Gust}
If the optional \kw{gust} keyword is used, a gust model can be added.
Note that a very elementary gust model, represented by a uniform change
in airstream speed and direction can be implemented by using
a time-dependent airstream drive.

Gusts can also be appended later to the \kw{air properties} element
by using the statement
%\begin{verbatim}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    \kw{gust} : \bnt{gust_model} ;
\end{Verbatim}
%\end{verbatim}


\paragraph{Front 1D Gust}
The syntax of the \kw{front 1D} gust model is:
%\begin{verbatim}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    \bnt{gust_model} ::= \kw{front 1D} ,
        (\hty{Vec3})        \bnt{front_direction} ,
        (\hty{Vec3})        \bnt{perturbation_direction} ,
        (\ty{real})      \bnt{front_velocity} ,
        (\hty{DriveCaller}) \bnt{front_profile}
\end{Verbatim}
%\end{verbatim}
This model consists in a uniform front, defined as
\begin{displaymath}
	\T{v}\plbr{\T{x}, t} = \T{n} g\plbr{\T{f} \cdot \T{x} + V_\mathrm{ref} \cdot t}
\end{displaymath}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $\T{v}$ is the velocity perturbation;
\item $\T{x}$ is the position of the point whose airstream velocity
is being computed;
\item $t$ is the current time;
\item $\T{n}$ is the unit vector \nt{perturbation\_direction} 
that defines the direction of the velocity perturbation;
\item $g\plbr{\cdot}$ is the function \nt{front\_profile} 
that defines the gust profile;
\item $\T{f}$ is the unit vector \nt{front\_direction} 
that defines the direction of propagation of the front;
\item $V_\mathrm{ref}$ is the velocity \nt{front\_velocity} 
of propagation of the front in direction $\T{f}$.
\end{itemize}
As an example, a transverse cosine-shaped gust, with a wavelength of 100 m
and a peak velocity of 5 m/s moving downstream at the airstream speed,
100 m/s, in standard air, is presented:
\begin{verbatim}
    set: real waveLength = 100.; # m
    set: real V_inf = 100.;      # m/s
    set: real V_g = 5.;          # m/s
    air properties: std, SI,
        1.,0.,0., const, V_inf,  # reference airstream along X
        gust, front 1D,
            1.,0.,0.,            # front moving along X
            0.,0.,1.,            # gust along Z
            V_inf,               # front moving at V_inf
            cosine, 0., pi/waveLength, V_g/2., one, 0.;
\end{verbatim}



\paragraph{Scalar Function Wind Profile}
The syntax of the \kw{scalar function} wind profile,
implemented as a gust model within the \kw{air properties}, is:
%\begin{verbatim}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    \bnt{gust_model} ::= \kw{scalar function} ,
        \kw{reference position} , (\hty{Vec3}) \bnt{X0} ,
        \kw{reference orientation} , (\hty{OrientationMatrix}) \bnt{R0} ,
        (\hty{ScalarFunction}) \bnt{sf}
\end{Verbatim}
%\end{verbatim}
It yields a uniform velocity profile along the $x$ axis of the
reference orientation as a function of the $z$ axis component
of the relative position; namely, given the relative position
\begin{align}
	z &= \T{e}_3 \cdot \plbr{\T{x} - \nt{X0}}
	,
\end{align}
the velocity is
\begin{align}
	\T{v}
	&=
	\T{e}_1 \cdot \nt{sf}(z)
	,
\end{align}
where $\T{e}_i$ is the $i$-th axis of the reference orientation \nt{R0}.



\paragraph{Power Law Wind Profile}
The syntax of the \kw{power law} wind profile, implemented as a gust model
within the \kw{air properties}, is:
%\begin{verbatim}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    \bnt{gust_model} ::= \kw{power law} ,
        \kw{reference position} , (\hty{Vec3}) \bnt{X0} ,
        \kw{reference orientation} , (\hty{OrientationMatrix}) \bnt{R0} ,
        \kw{reference elevation} , \bnt{z_ref} ,
        \kw{reference velocity} , (\hty{DriveCaller}) \bnt{v_ref} ,
        \kw{exponent} , \bnt{exponent}
\end{Verbatim}
%\end{verbatim}
It yields a uniform velocity profile along the $x$ axis of the
reference orientation as a function of the $z$ axis component
of the relative position; namely, given the relative position
\begin{align}
	z &= \T{e}_3 \cdot \plbr{\T{x} - \nt{X0}}
	,
\end{align}
the velocity is
\begin{align}
	\T{v}
	&=
	\T{e}_1 \cdot \nt{v\_ref} \plbr{\frac{z}{\nt{z\_ref}}}^{\nt{exponent}}
	,
\end{align}
where $\T{e}_i$ is the $i$-th axis of the reference orientation \nt{R0}.
Typical values of \nt{exponent} are about 0.1.



\paragraph{Logarithmic Wind Profile}
The syntax of the \kw{logarithmic} wind profile, implemented as a gust model
within the \kw{air properties}, is:
%\begin{verbatim}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    \bnt{gust_model} ::= \kw{logarithmic} ,
        \kw{reference position} , (\hty{Vec3}) \bnt{X0} ,
        \kw{reference orientation} , (\hty{OrientationMatrix}) \bnt{R0} ,
        \kw{reference elevation} , \bnt{z_ref} ,
        \kw{reference velocity} , (\hty{DriveCaller}) \bnt{v_ref} ,
        \kw{surface roughness length} , \bnt{z_0}
\end{Verbatim}
%\end{verbatim}
It yields a uniform velocity profile along the $x$ axis of the
reference orientation as a function of the $z$ axis component
of the relative position; namely, given the relative position
\begin{align}
	z &= \T{e}_3 \cdot \plbr{\T{x} - \nt{X0}}
	,
\end{align}
the velocity is
\begin{align}
	\T{v}
	&=
	\T{e}_1 \cdot \nt{v\_ref} \cdot \frac{
		\log(z/\nt{z\_0}) - \psi_m
	}{
		\log(\nt{z\_ref}/\nt{z\_0}) - \psi_m
	}
	,
\end{align}
where $\T{e}_i$ is the $i$-th axis of the reference orientation \nt{R0}.

The surface roughness length describes the typical roughness
of the surrounding surface.
It is a very small number in case of smooth surface
(e.g.\ 0.01m for grass),
or 1/20 to 1/30 of the typical obstacle's size (e.g.\ 1m for woods).


\paragraph{Output}
The output occurs in the \texttt{.air} file, which contains:
\begin{itemize}
\item a fake label, always set to 1
\item the air density
\item the sound celerity
\item the three components of the reference air speed
with respect to the inertial reference frame
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Private Data}
The following data are available:
\begin{itemize}
\item \kw{"vxinf"} the $x$ component of the airstream speed (without any gust contribution)
\item \kw{"vyinf"} the $y$ component of the airstream speed (without any gust contribution)
\item \kw{"vzinf"} the $z$ component of the airstream speed (without any gust contribution)
\item \kw{"vinf"} the module of the airstream speed (without any gust contribution)
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Generic Aerodynamic Force}
\label{sec:EL:AERO:GAF}
This element computes generalized aerodynamic forces parametrized
on dynamic pressure and angle of attack and sideslip angle.
%\begin{verbatim}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    \bnt{elem_type} ::= \kw{generic aerodynamic force}

    \bnt{normal_arglist} ::= \bnt{node_label} ,

    \bnt{data_file_specification} ::= \kw{file} , 
        [ \{ \kw{angle units} , \{ \kw{radians} | \kw{degrees} \}
            | \kw{scale angles} , \bnt{angle_scale_factor} \} , ]
        [ \kw{scale lengths} , \bnt{length_scale_factor} , ]
        " \bnt{data_file_name} "
\end{Verbatim}
%\end{verbatim}
This element computes aerodynamic forces and moments $\T{f}_a$, $\T{m}_a$
proportional to the dynamic pressure $q=\rho \T{v}^T \T{v}/2$
and to empirical coefficients tabulated as functions
of the angle of attack $\alpha$ and the sideslip angle $\beta$.
The angles are computed from the relative airstream velocity $\T{v}$
expressed in the reference frame of the body.
The velocity is computed at the reference point, optionally offset
from the node \nt{node\_label} by the offset \nt{relative\_position}
(defaults to \kw{null}), in a reference frame optionally oriented
from that of the node \nt{node\_label} by the orientation matrix
\nt{relative\_orientation} (defaults to \kw{eye}), namely
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	\TT{o} &= \text{(\hty{Vec3})} \ \nt{relative\_position}
	\\
	\TT{R}_h &= \text{(\hty{OrientationMatrix})}\ \nt{relative\_orientation}
	\\
	\TT{v} &= \TT{R}_h^T \TT{R}_n^T \plbr{
		\dot{\T{x}}_n + \T{\omega}_n \times \TT{R}_n \TT{o}
	}
	,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\T{x}_n$ and $\TT{R}_n$ are the position and orientation 
of the node, and $\dot{\T{x}}_n$ and $\T{\omega}_n$ are its linear
and angular velocity.
By default the angles are computed from the components of $\T{v}$
according to the formulas
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	\alpha
	&=
	\text{atan}\plbr{
		\cfrac{v_3}{\nrbr{v_1}}
	}
	\\
	\beta
	&=
	-\text{atan}\plbr{
		\cfrac{v_2}{\text{sign}(v_1)\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2}}
	}
	;
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
as a consequence, $-\pi/2 \le \alpha \le \pi/2$
and $-\pi \le \beta \le \pi$.
If the optional keyword \kw{alpha first} is set to \kw{yes},
the alternative formulas
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	\alpha
	&=
	\text{atan}\plbr{
		\cfrac{v_3}{\text{sign}(v_1)\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2}}
	}
	\\
	\beta
	&=
	-\text{atan}\plbr{
		\cfrac{v_2}{\nrbr{v_1}}
	}
	.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
are used; as a consequence, $-\pi \le \alpha \le \pi$
and $-\pi/2 \le \beta \le \pi/2$.
In both cases, they assume that the body reference system
is loosely aligned as:
\begin{itemize}
\item axis 1 goes from tail to nose of the aircraft;
\item axis 2 points ``to the right'';
\item axis 3 points towards the ground when the aircraft is in level flight.
\end{itemize}
Force and moment are consistently applied to the node as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	\T{f}_n &= \TT{R}_n \TT{R}_h \T{f}_a
	\\
	\T{m}_n &= \T{R}_n \TT{R}_h \TT{m}_a
		+ \TT{R}_n \plbr{\T{o} \times \plbr{\TT{R}_h \T{f}_a}}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\emph{Note: this element does not contribute to the Jacobian matrix
of the problem; as such, it may deteriorate the convergence properties
of the solution when aerodynamic forces dominate the problem.
Moreover, it is not suitable for the direct computation of the eigenvalues
of a problem about a steady solution.}

\emph{Note: this element, by itself, may not be adequate to model
the rigid body aerodynamics of an aircraft, since it does not
account for the dependence of force and moment on angle rates.}

\paragraph{Output}
The following output is available:
\begin{enumerate}
\item column 1: element label
\item column 2: the angle of attack $\alpha$
\item column 3: the sideslip angle $\beta$
\item columns 4--6: the components of force $\T{f}_a$
	in local $x$, $y$ and $z$ directions
\item columns 7--9: the components of moment $\T{m}_a$
	in local $x$, $y$ and $z$ directions,
	about the reference point (node plus offset)
\item columns 10--12: the components of force $\T{f}_n$
	in global $x$, $y$ and $z$ directions
\item columns 13--15: the components of moment $\T{m}_n$
	in global $x$, $y$ and $z$ directions,
	about the node
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Private Data}
The \kw{generic aerodynamic force} element outputs the following private data:
\begin{itemize}
\item \kw{"Fx"}, \kw{"Fy"}, \kw{"Fz"}:
	force components in the global reference frame;

\item \kw{"Mx"}, \kw{"My"}, \kw{"Mz"}:
	moment components in the global reference frame, about the node;

\item \kw{"fx"}, \kw{"fy"}, \kw{"fz"}:
	force components in the local reference frame;

\item \kw{"mx"}, \kw{"my"}, \kw{"mz"}:
	moment components in the local reference frame, about the reference point;

\item \kw{"alpha"}: angle of attack (in radian)

\item \kw{"beta"}: sideslip angle (in radian)
\end{itemize}
The values computed during the last residual assembly are returned.

\subsubsection{Generic Aerodynamic Element Data}
Data is stored in ASCII format in a file.

An arbitrary number of comment lines is allowed at the beginning.
Comment lines start with either a percent `\textbf{\%}'
or a hash mark `\texttt{\#}' in the first column.
Their content is discarded until the end of the line.

The first non-comment line must contain two integers separated by whitespace.
The integers represent the expected number of angle of attack
and sideslip angle values, $N_\alpha$ and $N_\beta$.

Another arbitrary number of comment lines is allowed.

A set of $N_\alpha \cdot N_\beta$ lines is expected.
No comments or empty lines are allowed in between.
Each line contains:
\begin{itemize}
\item column 1: the angle of attack, $\alpha$
\item column 2: the sideslip angle, $\beta$
\item columns 3--5: the force coefficients $f_{x/q}$, $f_{y/q}$, $f_{z/q}$
\item columns 6--8: the moment coefficients $m_{x/q}$, $m_{y/q}$, $m_{z/q}$
\end{itemize}

Notes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item lines are sorted as follows:
all values of $\alpha$ are defined for each value of $\beta$;
the same values of $\alpha$ are expected for each value of $\beta$;
\item the angle ranges are $-\pi/2 \le \alpha \le \pi/2$ and
$-\pi \le \beta \le \pi$; or, if \kw{alpha first} is \kw{yes},
they are $-\pi \le \alpha \le \pi$ and $-\pi/2 \le \beta \le \pi/2$;
\item the angles are expected in radians;
use the mutually exclusive optional keywords \kw{angle units},
to specify either \kw{radians} or \kw{degrees},
or \kw{scale angles}, to specify the \nt{angle\_scale\_factor}.
The \nt{angle\_scale\_factor} is the factor that when multiplied by the
angle transforms it into radians; for example, if angles are provided
in degrees then $\nt{angle\_scale\_factor} = \pi/180$;
\item $q=1/2 \rho V^2$ is the local reference dynamic pressure,
where $V$ is the norm of the velocity at the reference point;
\item the coefficients express forces and moments in the reference frame
attached to the body;
\item the coefficients are either expected in dimensional
or non-dimensional form.
In the former case, the force coefficients represent areas,
while the moment coefficients represent volumes, since they need
to be multiplied by the dynamic pressure to become forces and moments.
In the latter case, they are pure numbers; a \nt{reference\_surface}
and \nt{reference\_length} must be defined in the configuration
of the corresponding \kw{generic aerodynamic force} element.
When dimensional coefficients are specified, they can be rescaled
by using the optional keyword \kw{scale lengths} to specify
the \nt{length\_scale\_factor}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Induced velocity}
\label{sec:EL:AERO:INDVEL}
The \kw{induced velocity} element is used to associate the aerodynamic elements
that model the lifting surfaces of an aircraft,
or the blades of a helicopter rotor, when some inflow related computations 
are required.

By means of different inflow models, and by means
of the aerodynamic load contributions supplied by the aerodynamic elements,
the \kw{induced velocity} element is able to compute the induced velocity
at an arbitrary point on the lifting surface or rotor disk.
This velocity term in turn is used by the aerodynamic elements to determine
a better estimate of the boundary conditions.

The syntax of the \kw{induced velocity} elements is:
%\begin{verbatim}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    \bnt{elem_type} ::= \kw{induced velocity}

    \bnt{normal_arglist} ::= \bnt{induced_velocity_type} , \bnt{induced_velocity_data}
\end{Verbatim}
%\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Rotor}
\label{sec:EL:AERO:INDVEL:ROTOR}
Currently, induced velocity models are only implemented
for helicopter and cycloidal rotors.
For the latter, see Section~\ref{sec:MODULES:CYCLOCOPTER}.
Originally, this type of element was known as \kw{rotor},
and the original syntax is preserved for backwards compatibility.

The syntax of the helicopter rotor \kw{induced velocity} element is:
%\begin{verbatim}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    \bnt{induced_velocity_type} ::= \kw{rotor}

    \bnt{induced_velocity_data} ::= \bnt{craft_node} ,
            [ \kw{orientation} , (\hty{OrientationMatrix}) \bnt{rotor_orientation} , ]
        \bnt{rotor_node} ,
        \kw{induced velocity} , \bnt{induced_velocity_model}
\end{Verbatim}
%\end{verbatim}
The optional \nt{rotor\_orientation} is required when axis 3 
of the \nt{craft\_node} is not aligned with the rotor axis; axis 3
of the \nt{rotor\_node} must be aligned with the rotor axis.

There are five models of induced velocity. 
The first is no induced velocity; the syntax is:
%\begin{verbatim}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    \bnt{induced_velocity_model} ::= \kw{no}
\end{Verbatim}
%\end{verbatim}
There is no argument list. This element does not compute any induced
velocity, but still computes the rotor traction for output purposes,
if output is required.
The others have a fairly common syntax.  The first three are
\kw{uniform}, \kw{glauert} and \kw{mangler} induced velocity
models:
%\begin{verbatim}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    \bnt{induced_velocity_model} ::=
        \{ \kw{uniform} | \kw{glauert} [ , \kw{type} , \bnt{glauert_type} ] | \kw{mangler} \} , 
        \bnt{reference_omega} , \bnt{reference_radius}
        [ , \bnt{option} [ , ... ] ]

    \bnt{glauert_type} ::= \{ \kw{glauert} | \kw{coleman} | \kw{drees}
        | \kw{payne} | \kw{white and blake} | \kw{pitt and peters} | \kw{howlett} \}

    \bnt{option} ::=
        \{ \kw{ground} , \bnt{ground_node}
            | \kw{delay} , (\hty{DriveCaller}) \bnt{memory_factor}
            | \kw{max iterations} , \bnt{max_iterations}
            | \kw{tolerance} , \bnt{tolerance}
            | \kw{eta} , \bnt{eta}
            | \kw{correction} , \bnt{hover_correction_factor}, \bnt{ff_correction_factor} \}
\end{Verbatim}
%\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item
The \nt{reference\_omega} field is used to decide whether
the induced velocity computation must be inhibited because the rotor speed
is very low.

\item
The \nt{reference\_radius} field is used to make the rotor related parameters
non-dimensional.

\item
The \kw{ground} parameter is used to inform the rotor about the proximity
to the ground; the $z$ component of the distance between the rotor
and the ground nodes, in the ground node reference frame
(direction 3, positive),
is used for an approximate correction of the axial inflow velocity
\cite{NASA-TR-3021}.

\item
The \nt{memory\_factor}, the \nt{hover\_correction\_factor} 
and the \nt{ff\_correction\_factor} (forward flight) are
used to correct the nominal induced velocity, according to the formula
\begin{align*}
	U_{\text{effective}}
	&=
	\plbr{1 - \nt{memory\_factor}} U_{\text{nominal}}
	\\
	&+ \nt{memory\_factor} \ U_{\text{previous}}
\end{align*}
with
\begin{align*}
	U_{\text{nominal}}
	&=
	\frac{T}{2 \rho A V_{\text{tip}} \sqrt{
		\cfrac{\lambda^2}{\nt{hover\_correction\_factor}^4}
		+ \cfrac{\mu^2}{\nt{ff\_correction\_factor}^2}
	}}
\end{align*}
The \kw{delay} parameter is used to linearly combine the current
reference induced velocity with the induced velocity at the previous step;
no delay means there is no memory of the previous value.
The memory factor behaves like a discrete first-order low-pass filter.
As a consequence, its behavior depends on the integration time step.
The \nt{memory\_factor} parameter defaults to 0.
The \nt{hover\_correction\_factor} 
and \nt{ff\_correction\_factor} parameters default to 1.

\item
The \nt{max\_iterations}, \nt{tolerance} 
and \nt{eta} parameters refer to the iteration cycle 
that is performed to compute the nominal induced velocity.
After \nt{max\_iterations}, or when the absolute value 
of the difference between two iterations of the nominal induced 
velocity is less than \nt{tolerance}, the cycle ends.
Only a fraction \nt{eta} of the difference between two
iterations of the nominal induced velocity is actually
used; \nt{eta} defaults to 1.
The default is to make only one iteration, which is backward-compatible
with the original behavior.
\end{itemize}

The last induced velocity model uses a dynamic inflow model,
based on \cite{PITT}, with 3 inflow states.
The syntax is:
%\begin{verbatim}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
    \bnt{induced_velocity_model} ::= \kw{dynamic inflow} , 
        \bnt{reference_omega} , 
        \bnt{reference_radius} 
        [ , \bnt{option} [ , ... ] ]

    \bnt{option} ::=
        \{ \kw{ground} , \bnt{<ground_node}
            | \kw{initial value} , \bnt{const_vel} , \bnt{cosine_vel} , \bnt{sine_vel}
            | \kw{max iterations} , \bnt{max_iterations}
            | \kw{tolerance} , \bnt{tolerance}
            | \kw{eta} , \bnt{eta}
            | \kw{correction} , \bnt{hover_correction_factor} , \bnt{ff_correction_factor} \}
\end{Verbatim}
%\end{verbatim}
Most of the parameters are the same as for the previous models.
The optional \kw{delay} parameter is no longer allowed.
The three states, corresponding to uniform, fore-aft and lateral inflow,
can be explicitly initialized by means of the optional 
\kw{initial value} parameter.

\paragraph{Output}
The following output is available for all rotor elements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item column 1: element label
\item columns 2--4: rotor force in $x$, $y$ and $z$ directions
	(longitudinal, lateral and thrust components)
\item columns 5--7: rotor moment about $x$, $y$ and $z$ directions
	(roll, pitch and torque components)
\item column 8: mean inflow velocity, based on momentum theory
\item column 9: reference velocity at rotor center, sum of airstream
	and \nt{craft\_node} node velocity
\item column 10: rotor disk angle
\item column 11: advance parameter $\mu$
\item column 12: inflow parameter $\lambda$
\item column 13: advance/inflow angle $\chi=\tan^{-1}\plbr{\mu/\lambda}$
\item column 14: reference azimuthal direction $\psi_0$,
	related to rotor yaw angle
\item column 15: boolean flag indicating convergence
	in reference induced velocity computation internal iterations
\item column 16: number of iterations required for convergence
\newcounter{elem_rotor_output}
\setcounter{elem_rotor_output}{\value{enumi}}
\end{enumerate}
The \kw{dynamic inflow} model adds the columns
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\value{elem_rotor_output}}
\item column 17: constant inflow state
\item column 18: sine inflow state (lateral)
\item column 19: cosine inflow state (longitudinal)
\end{enumerate}
Rotor force and moment (columns 2--4 and 5--7) are the aerodynamic
force and moment exerted by the rotor aerodynamics on the \nt{rotor\_node},
projected in the reference frame of the \nt{craft\_node},
optionally modified by the \nt{rotor\_orientation} matrix.
The conventional naming of longitudinal (or drag), lateral and thrust force,
and roll, pitch and torque moment, refer to a rotorcraft
whose $x$ axis is the longitudinal (nose to tail) axis,
whose $y$ axis is the lateral (portside) axis,
and whose $z$ axis is the vertical (bottom to top) axis.

\paragraph{Private Data}
The following data are available:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \kw{"Tx"} rotor force in $x$ direction (longitudinal force)
\item \kw{"Ty"} rotor force in $y$ direction (lateral force)
\item \kw{"Tz"} rotor force in $z$ direction (thrust)
\item \kw{"Mx"} rotor moment about $x$ direction (roll moment)
\item \kw{"My"} rotor moment about $y$ direction (pitch moment)
\item \kw{"Mz"} rotor moment about $z$ direction (torque)
\end{enumerate}
The rotor force and moment components are expressed in the same reference
frame described in the Output Section above.
