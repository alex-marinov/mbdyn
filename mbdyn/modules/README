The `modules' directory contains user-defined modules (originally,
user-defined elements).  To enable user-defined modules:

  - make sure MBDyn is configured with --enable-runtime-loading
  - create a subdirectory `module-<user>' in directory `modules'
  - create a (set of) source file(s) implementing the user-defined
    module; the file `module-<user>.<ext>' must be present, where
    `<ext>' is based on the language (.c, .cc, .f, .f90 should work
    for C, C++, F77, F90 respectively).
  - if required, copy Makefile.template in `module-<user>'
    as Makefile.inc and add the other dependencies
  - configure the module for build using `--with-module=<user>',
    where `<user>' is a whitespace separated list of modules.

For instance, to enable the `module-template' user-defined module,
add `--with-module=template' to your configure command.
