set: real RDL = 20.;		# road loop condition (will loop after RDB+RDL over RDL) loop transfer zone must be done over a smooth zone (at least the size of half the contact patch length!) (ie: want, ideally, matching slopes on two first and two last points of the profile and matchin heights on first and alst points)
### ,road conditions

#######NOTE: (smoothens the results even with kappa being capped) this buffer needs to be tuned for best performance and has a significant impact on the stability of the tire, depending on the values chosen the tire will start to oscillate between positive and negative values or not.#######
