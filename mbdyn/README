developers:

	- check out from the CVS tree
	- run "sh ./bootstrap.sh" to generate ancillary files.
	  May need some tailoring.  A system with working autoconf, 
	  automake and libtool is required; I'm currently using 
	  autoconf 2.59, automake 1.9.6, libtool 1.5.6
	- tar the tree and move to the target system; this way, all
	  the ancillary files will be available even if the target 
	  system does not have those tools.



developers without CVS access:

	- ask for a snapshot from the CVS
	- merge: two approaches; either
		1) post patches to the checked out sources;
		   assuming mbdyn-HEAD is the original snapshot,
		   and mbdyn-DEVEL is the locally modified version,
		   run

	diff -uNr mbdyn-HEAD mbdyn-DEVEL > AUTHOR-DATE-DESC.patch

		   where
			- AUTHOR is the name of the Author,
			- DATE is the date of the snapshot,
			- DESC is a short description of the modifications.

		   Or

		2) post the modified source tree, including the CVS
		   directories and their contents, unmodified



distribution:

	- set build/version to the right number
	- set MBDYN_DEVEL=no in configure.in
	- follow the above instructions
	- run "./configure" with the desired options
	- add version and release date to NEWS
	- add version and release notes to CHANGES
	- check BUGS
	- advance MBDYN_REL_ENG tag after running ./check_cvs.sh
	- set MBDYN_REL_ENG_<version> tag
	- run "make dist"
	- update http://www.mbdyn.org/ web page



installation:

	- get a working source tree, either by following the "developers"
	  or the "distribution" instructions or from the web site
	  <http://www.aero.polimi.it/~mbdyn/>
	- configure the package; "./configure" will suffice in most cases,
	  unless you need some of the supported packages and they are not 
	  in the standard place
	- "make" the package
	- run "make install"; the command "mbdyn" and some utilities will
	  be installed in "$PREFIX/bin", while some libraries will be put
	  in "$PREFIX/lib" (PREFIX defaults to /usr/local/mbdyn).
	  Those libraries are neither required to run mbdyn nor the utilities
	  (unless you force the shared build).
	  A bare-bone man page will be installed in "$PREFIX/man/man1".
